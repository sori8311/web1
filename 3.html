<p><a href="https://www.google.co.kr/" target="_blank" title="google webpage">Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson)</a> grows up in Cornwall, in a house by the sea with his father James (Bill Nighy), mother Mary (Lindsay Duncan), absent-minded uncle Desmond (Richard Cordery), and free-spirited sister Katherine or "Kit Kat" (Lydia Wilson). At the age of 21, Tim learns from his father that the men of his family have the secret ability to travel back in time, to moments they have lived before. In order to time travel, they must be in a dark space, clench their fists and visualize the memory they wish to travel back to. James discourages his son from using his gift to acquire money or fame, and Tim decides he will use it to improve his love life.</p><p style="margin-top:40px;">The following summer, Kit Kat's friend Charlotte (Margot Robbie) visits. Tim is instantly smitten, but waits until the end of her stay to tell her how he feels; she tells him that he should have told her earlier. Tim travels back in time to tell Charlotte in the middle of the holiday, but she says it would be better to wait until her last day. Heartbroken, Tim realizes she is uninterested in him, and that time travel cannot change anyone's mind.</p>

<p style="margin-top:60px;">Tim moves to London to pursue a career as a lawyer, living with his father's acquaintance, Harry (Tom Hollander), an angry misanthropic playwright. Tim visits a Dans le Noir restaurant, where he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams). They flirt in the darkness, and afterward, Mary gives Tim her phone number. Tim returns home to find a distraught Harry, whose opening night of his new play has been ruined by an actor forgetting his lines. Tim goes back in time to put things right, and the play is a triumph.</p>
